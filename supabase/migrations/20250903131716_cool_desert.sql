/*
  # Create children table and authentication system

  1. New Tables
    - `children`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text, child's name)
      - `emoji` (text, child's avatar emoji)
      - `pin_hash` (text, bcrypt hashed PIN)
      - `parent_id` (uuid, foreign key to parents)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `children` table
    - Add policies for parents to manage their children
    - Add policies for anonymous access during child login
